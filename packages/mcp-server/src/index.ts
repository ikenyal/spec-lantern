 * Home of the MCP_Server deliverable: the sandbox-boundary owner that exposes
 * MCP tools (`execute_properties`, `apply_fixes_and_reexecute`,
 * `replay_counterexample`) and owns the Isolated_Runner. Tools, the Safety
 * Gate, and the runner lifecycle are implemented in tasks 7-16. This
 * scaffolding entrypoint only confirms the package wiring.
